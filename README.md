# Croatian Vocabulary Quiz 🇭🇷

A lightweight terminal quiz for practicing Croatian vocabulary.
I built this tool while learning Python, so I could combine programming practice with language learning.

Since there is no Croatian-Polish course available in apps like Duolingo, I created my own way to study Croatian daily on my Android phone. I run this program in the Termux app with Python installed and use it regularly to learn and memorize new words.

The tool includes a built-in list of the 1,000 most frequent Croatian words to help build core vocabulary effectively.
